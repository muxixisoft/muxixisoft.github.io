# Data Deletion Policy for TimerCamera+

TimerCamera+ (developed by Muxixi Studios) does not collect or store any personal user data on our own servers.

Our app uses third-party services from Google (Google AdMob and Google Play Billing) which may collect data (such as Ad IDs and Purchase History) according to their own policies.

## How to Request Deletion

Because we do not store your data, we do not have a system to delete it. However, you can manage and delete data collected by Google's services directly:

* **For AdMob (Ad ID):** You can reset your device's Advertising ID at any time in your phone's "Settings" > "Google" > "Ads".
* **For Play Billing (Purchase History):** This data is managed by Google Play and is necessary to restore your "Remove Ads" purchase. It can be managed via your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).

If you have any questions, please contact us at **muxixisoft@gmail.com**.
